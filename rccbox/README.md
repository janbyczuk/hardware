# Buttonbox for race control features (planned)

The box utilizes a Teensy 3.5 microcontroller because it has

* 5V tolerance on most pins
* enough I/O pins to map all the buttons and functions

All button / encoder actions are mapped to teensy joystick buttons exept the EXIT button which generates 
a ESC key press as a normal keyboard would.
